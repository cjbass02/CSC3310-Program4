    "This program aims to benchmark various functions from the heapq libary. The \"heapify\", \"heappush\", \"heappop\", and \"heapreplace\" functions will be tested against various input arrays to record their results to expected results. Additionally, each function will be benchmarked with best, worst, and average case arrays with sizes 10, 100, 1000, and 100000 to asess their theoretical run time against their actual benchmarked run time. Each heapq opperation will be analyzed with a log-linear regression model to predict its Big O time complexity."
